# go.sum

- The go.sum file in Go is used alongside the go.mod file to ensure the integrity and reproducibility of your project's dependencies.
- When you first add a dependency (e.g., by running go get), Go records the version of the module in the go.mod file and the checksum of that version in the go.sum file.
- If someone else clones your project and runs go build, go test, or go mod tidy, Go will check the go.sum file to ensure the integrity of the dependencies being downloaded.
- Example of go.sum file -

- Each line contains:
    - The module path and version.
    - A hash type (h1) and the checksum.
- You don’t need to manually edit the go.sum file.It’s automatically generated and updated by Go commands like go mod tidy, go get, go build, and go test.
