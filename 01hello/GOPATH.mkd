# GOPATH & Go Modules

## GOPATH

- GOPATH is an environment variable that specifies the location of your workspace, where your Go code, dependencies, and binaries are stored.
- Example Structure

    src:
    - Contains the source code of Go projects.
    - Each project resides in its own directory under src.
    
    pkg:
    - Contains compiled package objects, organized by operating system and architecture.
    - This helps in speeding up the build process by reusing compiled packages.

    bin:
    - Contains compiled binaries (executables).
    - When you run go install, the binaries are placed here.
  


## Transition to Go Modules

- Project Location - With Go modules, your projects no longer need to be located within the GOPATH/src directory. You can create and work on Go projects anywhere on your filesystem.
- Go modules manage dependencies on a per-project basis using go.mod and go.sum files.This eliminates the need for a centralized GOPATH/pkg directory for dependency management.
- Each project can have its own set of dependencies, versions, and configurations, independent of other projects.

- GOPATH still serves as a default module cache location and supports backward compatibility, but its role in Go development has been greatly minimized.
