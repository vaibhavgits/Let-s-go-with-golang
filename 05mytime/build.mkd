# Build

- You can build executables for Linux, Windows and Mac using golang. The command is - **go build**
- Go searches "GOOS" environment variable, suppose GOOS="darwin", then it will build executables for Mac. 

    Note - "darwin" is used for Mac.

- If you want to build executables for linux, you can run command - **GOOS="linux" go build**
